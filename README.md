# The ECG teaching project
This is the GitHub (test) repository for the ECG teaching project. The project is designed to be collaborative, and there's not a good set of tools to work together. This is one way of doing it.
The plan is to use GitPitch to display presentations. GitHub will serve as the collaborative workspace that the presentations can be edited together. This means that anyone can update and improve the presentations when they want to.

To see the presentation on gitpitch, try this URL:
https://gitpitch.com/deepankardatta/ecg-teaching?p=ecg-1/

Change the 1 at the end to any other number to see which presentations are available
