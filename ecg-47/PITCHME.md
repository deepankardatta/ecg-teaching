### ECG no. 47 (Under development)
##### Written by: Deepankar Datta

---

## The scenario

- Patient with 4 days of "shaking", 2 days of chest pain
- Known ESRF: on dialysis
- Had an operation on her fistula 5 days ago
- Ambulance ECG showed widespread ST elevation: PPCI service feels pericarditis

## What the ECG shows

- Regular rhythm
- Widespread ST-elevation
- Maybe something more
- And something more

---

## What do you do?

---

## Progress

- Initial observations:
- Terrible IV access
- Pain controlled with morphine
- K+ = 7.something
- Repeat T = 38.4 (deg)C

## Diagnosis?

+++

## Diagnosis

(1) Sepsis
(2) Hyperkalaemia

---

## Treatment?

- (Scroll down)

+++

## Treatment for extreme hyperkalaemia

- Calcium gluconate 10% - multiple 10ml boluses
- Salbutamol nebuliser
- IV insulin & dextrose
- (Scroll down)

+++

## Resolving ECG changes

- Chuck the repeat ECG here

+++

## Treatment for sepsis

- Likely source operation site
- Microbiology swab from operation showed ?pseudomonas and ?staph
- Given sepsis treatment for unknown source to cover
- Treated with amoxicillin, flucloxacillin, metronidazole and gentamicin

+++

## Progress

- Become hypotensive
- Admitted to ITU for treatment of septic shock
- Also haemofiltered
- Better after initial treatment and transferred to care of renal team

---

## Learning points

- Try and get early blood sampling in dialysis patients
- Extreme hyperkalaemia (K+ > 7) can lead to bizarre ECG abnormalities, and can mimimc ST elevation
